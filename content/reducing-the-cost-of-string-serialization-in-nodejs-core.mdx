Serializing strings in Node.js has been a pain point for web developers,
particularly when it comes to URL operations. Recently, with the help of
[Daniel Lemire](https://lemire.me), we conducted a research to reduce the cost
of string serialization in Node.js core particularly in the context of URL
parsing, resulting in a series of optimizations that addressed the issue. By
implementing these techniques, we were able to improve the performance of URL
parsing and formatting, as well as reducing memory usage and improving overall
stability. In this article, we will delve into the challenges we encountered
while optimizing string serialization in Node.js, and the techniques we used to
achieve significant performance improvements.

## Quick Recap

> How does C++ code communicate with JavaScript code in Node.js?

Node.js exposes C++ classes to the JavaScript layer through the
[V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev) exposes them using a function
called `internalBinding` where each subsystem of Node.js registers its
own bindings through certain functions.

```cpp title="src/node_buffer.cc" {5, 9, 12, 13}
void Initialize(Local<Object> target,
                Local<Value> unused,
                Local<Context> context,
                void* priv) {
  SetMethod(context, target, "setBufferPrototype", SetBufferPrototype);
}

void RegisterExternalReferences(ExternalReferenceRegistry* registry) {
  registry->register(SetBufferPrototype);
}

NODE_BINDING_CONTEXT_AWARE_INTERNAL(buffer, node::Buffer::Initialize)
NODE_BINDING_EXTERNAL_REFERENCE(buffer, node::Buffer::RegisterExternalReferences)
```

The internals of how `internalBinding` is created, maintained and used is out
of context of this article. For more information, please refer to the
Github discussion I've created called [Communication steps between JS and C++](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/discussions/47220).

## Problem Definition

Here is a quick overview of the implementation provided by Node.js v19.8.0.
The code below is a simplified version of the actual implementation, and
does not include base url as the parameter.

Whenever a user calls `new URL` inside Node.js, the following class is created.
This class is a wrapper for calling the actual implementation in C++ provided
by [the Ada URL parser](https://github.com/ada-url/ada).

The following code is available on [Github](https://github.com/anonrig/node/blob/26a967f6d0d111d72da6ea34634854e2ba8c517f/lib/internal/url.js#L567).

```js title="Node.js URL class constructor" {8}
const { parse } = internalBinding('url');

class URL {
  #context = new URLContext();

  constructor(input) {
    input = `${input}`;
    if (!parse(input, this.#onParseComplete)) {
      throw new ERR_INVALID_URL(input);
    }
  }
}
```

The `parse` method takes 2 parameters, input and the completion callback.
This is mostly done to avoid the overhead of creating a new object for each
function.

For example, the following code is slow due to the serialization cost of objects:

```js title="Object serialization example" {3}
const parse = internalBinding('url');
const url = 'https://www.yagiz.co';
const { isValid, ...rest } = parse(url);
if (isValid) {
  console.log(`parsed href is ${rest.href}`);
}
```

In the example above, the `parse` function returns a boolean `isValid` and
other properties of the parsed URL. However, the `parse` function returns
these properties regardless of the `isValid` flag. This means that the
the structure of the `rest` object is unknown on the compile time, and
V8 has to do its magic to optimize it as much as it can.

Let's dive into the details of how the `parse` function is implemented.

The URL constructor by default calls a C++ function called `parse` which is
defined inside `src/node_url.cc`. The `parse` function is defined as follows:

```cpp title="Parse"
void Parse(const FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>& args) {
  CHECK_GE(args.Length(), 2);
  CHECK(args[0]->IsString());  // input
  CHECK(args[1]->IsFunction());  // complete callback

  Local<Function> success_callback_ = args[2].As<Function>();

  Environment* env = Environment::GetCurrent(args);
  HandleScope handle_scope(env->isolate());
  Context::Scope context_scope(env->context());

  Utf8Value input(env->isolate(), args[0]);
  ada::result out = ada::parse(input.ToStringView());

  if (!out) {
    return args.GetReturnValue().Set(false);
  }

  auto argv = GetCallbackArgs(env, out);
  USE(success_callback_->Call(
      env->context(), args.This(), argv.size(), argv.data()));
  args.GetReturnValue().Set(true);
}
```

Whenever the parse function is called, it needs to be called with
`input` parameter which is a string, and a callback function to pass
the values back to the JavaScript layer. This is a smart way of solving
the serialization problem of objects, and it is also a very common pattern
in Node.js core. Unfortunately, this pattern leads to making this function
a function that has a side effect. Meaning, it has to mutate the callback
according to the result of the parsing.

Here's an example of how the callback is mutated to return the result
to the JavaScript layer:

```cpp title="GetCallbackArgs" {8-19}
auto GetCallbackArgs(Environment* env, const ada::result& url) {
  Local<Context> context = env->context();
  Isolate* isolate = env->isolate();

  auto js_string = [&](std::string_view sv) {
    return ToV8Value(context, sv, isolate).ToLocalChecked();
  };
  return std::array{
      js_string(url->get_href()),
      js_string(url->get_origin()),
      js_string(url->get_protocol()),
      js_string(url->get_hostname()),
      js_string(url->get_pathname()),
      js_string(url->get_search()),
      js_string(url->get_username()),
      js_string(url->get_password()),
      js_string(url->get_port()),
      js_string(url->get_hash()),
  };
}
```

In order to process and save this data on the JavaScript layer,
preferably in URL class, JavaScript layer had to have a `heavy`
function to update the current context of the URL:

```js title="Simplified version of the URL class onParseComplete function" {1-2}
#onParseComplete = (href, origin, protocol, hostname, pathname,
                    search, username, password, port, hash) => {
  this.#context.href = href;
  this.#context.origin = origin;
  this.#context.protocol = protocol;
  this.#context.hostname = hostname;
  this.#context.pathname = pathname;
  this.#context.search = search;
  this.#context.username = username;
  this.#context.password = password;
  this.#context.port = port;
  this.#context.hash = hash;
};
```

This implementation as you've realized is not very efficient. It requires
sharing the knowledge of the callback function parameters, by index, between
JavaScript and C++. On top of this being a bad practice, there is a lot of
room for improvement in terms of performance.

This wasn't a problem until now, where the true performance cost of this
function lied in the fact that the URL parser was slow. However, with
[Ada URL parser](https://github.com/ada-url/ada) the bottleneck was moved
to the serialization of the result.

As you know the URL contains a lot of properties, where `href` is the only
attribute that contains all of the properties of URL, hence the identifier
of the URL.

```shell title="URL properties"
> new URL('https://www.yagiz.co')
URL {
  href: 'https://www.yagiz.co/',
  origin: 'https://www.yagiz.co',
  protocol: 'https:',
  username: '',
  password: '',
  host: 'www.yagiz.co',
  hostname: 'www.yagiz.co',
  port: '',
  pathname: '/',
  search: '',
  searchParams: URLSearchParams {},
  hash: ''
}
```

As you might notice, origin, protocol, host, hostname and others are all
substrings of `href`. Well, the solution is not as simple as this, because
the `origin` might differ from `URL` where the `hostname` can be different
with different `pathname` values. There are lots of edge cases that needs
to be resolved if we are going to resolve this.

## The Solution

With [Ada URL Parser v2.0.0](https://github.com/ada-url/ada), we incorporated
Servo URL's approach to storing the URL properties. The idea is to store the
href, and use offsets to represent the URL properties. This way, we can have
access to the URL properties without knowing the **business logic** behind
"How to parse a URL?".

### URL Components

```text title="URL Components structure"
https://user:pass@example.com:1234/foo/bar?baz#quux
      |     |    |          | ^^^^|       |   |
      |     |    |          | |   |       |   `----- hash_start
      |     |    |          | |   |       `--------- search_start
      |     |    |          | |   `----------------- pathname_start
      |     |    |          | `--------------------- port
      |     |    |          `----------------------- host_end
      |     |    `---------------------------------- host_start
      |     `--------------------------------------- username_end
      `--------------------------------------------- protocol_end
```

The structure of the URL class stayed the same, but with little caveats.
On the C++ side, we created a class called `BindingData`.

```cpp title="src/node_url.h"
class BindingData : public SnapshotableObject {
 public:
  // This is a simplified version of the class
  static void Parse(const v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value>& args);

  static void Initialize(v8::Local<v8::Object> target,
                         v8::Local<v8::Value> unused,
                         v8::Local<v8::Context> context,
                         void* priv);
  static void RegisterExternalReferences(ExternalReferenceRegistry* registry);

 private:
  static constexpr size_t kURLComponentsLength = 9;
  AliasedUint32Array url_components_buffer_;
};
```

### `Bindingdata`

`Bindingdata` class is initialized and snapshotted in the build time
and is used to store an `AliasedUint32Array` called `url_components_buffer_`
with a length of `9` unsigned integers. This property will be used to store the
offsets of the URL. Due to the single-threaded environment and the non-parallel
execution of the URL parser, we ensure that that only **1** Uint32Array is
created for parsing URLs throughout the lifecycle of the Node.js application.

```cpp title="src/node_url.cc"
void BindingData::Parse(const FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>& args) {
  CHECK_GE(args.Length(), 1);
  CHECK(args[0]->IsString());  // input
  // args[1] // base url

  BindingData* binding_data = Realm::GetBindingData<BindingData>(args);
  Environment* env = Environment::GetCurrent(args);
  HandleScope handle_scope(env->isolate());
  Context::Scope context_scope(env->context());

  Utf8Value input(env->isolate(), args[0]);
  auto out = ada::parse<ada::url_aggregator>(input.ToStringView());

  if (!out) {
    return args.GetReturnValue().Set(false);
  }

  binding_data->UpdateComponents(out->get_components(), out->type);

  args.GetReturnValue().Set(
      ToV8Value(env->context(), out->get_href(), env->isolate())
          .ToLocalChecked());
}
```

As a result of this optimization, we just need to update the
`url_components_buffer_` with the offsets of the URL properties. This
is done by the `binding_data->UpdateComponents` method.

### JavaScript class

Let's dive into the JavaScript implementation of the URL class.
Here's the implementation as of Node.js 20 (April 24, 2023).

```js title="URL class"
const bindingUrl = internalBinding('url');

class URL {
  #context = new URLContext();

  constructor(input, base = undefined) {
    input = `${input}`;

    const href = bindingUrl.parse(input, base);

    if (!href) {
      throw new ERR_INVALID_URL(input);
    }

    this.#updateContext(href);
  }
}
```

The `parse` method returned a string or an undefined value depending
on the success of the parsing function. The string value represents
the `href` part of the URL. Immediately after successful parsing,
`this.#updateContext(href)` method is called to access the URL
components (indexes of the URL properties) and update the current
url instance context. As a result, the cost of parsing an invalid
URL has significantly decreased.

### Updating the URL context

```js title="Simplified version of #updateContext(href) implementation" /bindingUrl.urlComponents/
#updateContext(href) {
  const {
    0: protocol_end,
    1: username_end,
    2: host_start,
    3: host_end,
    4: port,
    5: pathname_start,
    6: search_start,
    7: hash_start,
    8: scheme_type,
  } = bindingUrl.urlComponents;

  this.#context.protocol_end = protocol_end;
  this.#context.username_end = username_end;
  this.#context.host_start = host_start;
  this.#context.host_end = host_end;
  this.#context.port = port;
  this.#context.pathname_start = pathname_start;
  this.#context.search_start = search_start;
  this.#context.hash_start = hash_start;
  this.#context.scheme_type = scheme_type;
}
```

Due to the object destructure of `bindingUrl.urlComponents`,
the barrier between JavaScript and C++ is only crossed once,
reducing the performance cost of string serialization.

## Caveats

The usage of indexes as offsets to access the URL properties
through a string is not a new idea. As most of you knew, it's
called lazy loading.

> What is lazy loading?

In the context of algorithms, lazy loading is a strategy for optimizing
performance by deferring the calculation of values until they are actually
needed. This is often used in cases where computing all possible values in
advance would be inefficient or impractical. Instead, the algorithm only
calculates values as they are requested, often caching the results for future
use. This approach can help reduce the amount of computation required, improve
memory usage, and speed up the overall execution time of the algorithm.
Examples of algorithms that may use lazy loading include memoization, dynamic
programming, and certain types of graph traversal algorithms.

## Conclusions

The usage of lazy-loading forces us to know the context of where lazy loading
is used. In the case of the URL class, the cost of parsing vs. the cost of
accessing the URL properties is the main factor that we need to consider.
As a result of this experiment, and optimizations done on both
[Ada](https://github.com/ada-url/ada) and Node.js, we were able to reduce
the performance cost of parsing by a significant amount.

Here's the result of parsing 100,000 URLs in different Node.js versions:

```
Node.js 20         38.97 ms/iter
Node.js 19.8.1     79.29 ms/iter
Node.js 19.7.0    105.59 ms/iter
Node.js 19.6.1    140.42 ms/iter
```
