Ada is the fastest WHATWG-compliant URL parser in the world. Ada is now used by major products and softwares like Node.js, ClickHouse, Redpanda, Kong, Telegram and Cloudflare Workers. [We are excited][contributors] to announce the release of Ada v3.0.
This major release includes a lot of new features, improvements and bug fixes.

Since our last release (v2.9.2), published on September 2, 2024,
[there have been 262 commits written by 9 contributors][diff-between-292].
Ada is now used by major products and softwares like Node.js, ClickHouse,
Redpanda, Kong, Telegram and Cloudflare Workers.

## New features

- Ada now supports Bazel build system.
- Ada now supports Unicode 15.1.0 through [ada_idna][ada-idna] library.
- Ada now includes an experimental URLPattern implementation that allows
you to define URL patterns for your routes, and match them.
  - It doesn't provide a regex engine and leaves the decision
  of choosing the right engine to the implementor. This is done as a
  security measure since the default std::regex engine is not safe
  and open to DDOS attacks.
  If your url pattern inputs come from an untrusted source (like a user),
  you *should not* use std::regex in production. Unsafe regular expression
  libraries have unbounded memory consumption and execution times.
  The only safe implementations known to authors at this time are "v8" and "re2"
  which is safe and performant.
  - In future releases, we will expand our C API to support URLPattern as well.

```cpp
// Define a regex engine that conforms to the following interface
// For eample we will use v8 regex engine

class v8_regex_provider {
 public:
  v8_regex_provider() = default;
  using regex_type = v8::Global<v8::RegExp>;
  static std::optional<regex_type> create_instance(std::string_view pattern,
                                                   bool ignore_case);
  static std::optional<std::vector<std::optional<std::string>>> regex_search(
      std::string_view input, const regex_type& pattern);
  static bool regex_match(std::string_view input, const regex_type& pattern);
};

// Define a URLPattern
auto pattern = ada::parse_url_pattern<v8_regex_provider>(("/books/:id(\\d+)", "https://example.com");

// Check validity
if (!pattern) { return EXIT_FAILURE; }

// Match a URL
auto match = pattern->match("https://example.com/books/123");

// Test a URL
auto matched = pattern->test("https://example.com/books/123");
```

## Changes

- Ada library now includes the source code of CPM (C++ Package Manager)
to avoid the need of installing it through the internet.


## Breaking changes

- Ada now uses C++20 features which requires minimum of GCC 12 or LLVM 14.
- `ada::errors::generic` has been replaced with `ada::errors::type_error`

We have made a lot of improvements to the library, and we strongly suggest you
to upgrade to v3.0 to benefit for these improvements.
